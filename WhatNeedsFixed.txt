Basic FPS Notes (Issuse I want to Fix)
If these are still not fixed when turned in I would like help to fix them so I dont make these mistakes again.

-jump is broken
when line is un commented the player will contanly jump

-Cammera is broken
what is even happening with the background? did I attached the script to the wrong thing.

-Shoot
tried reporpouseing code from another project(horble idea in this case)

-magic
was going to wait ontill Shoot was fixed

If (target is ItemA )
{
 magic += 10;
}
else if (target is ItemB)
{
 magic -= 5;
}
raycast tell if target is A or B
