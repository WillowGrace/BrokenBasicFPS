Basic FPS Notes (Issuse I want to Fix)
If these are still not fixed when turned in I would like help to fix them so I dont make these mistakes again.

fixed -jump is broken
when line is un commented the player will contanly jump

fixed -Cammera is broken
what is even happening with the background? did I attached the script to the wrong thing.

can shoot but "bulet" is still not atached and no damage is done-Shoot
tried reporpouseing code from another project(horble idea in this case)

changed - is now what is being shoot at - still broken-magic
